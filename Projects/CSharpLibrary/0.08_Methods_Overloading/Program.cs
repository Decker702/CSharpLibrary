        Member overloading means creating two or more members on the same type that differ only 
        in the number or type of parameters but have the same name.
        
            For example, in the following, the WriteLine method is overloaded:
            
            public static class Console
             {
            public void WriteLine();
            public void WriteLine(string value);
            public void WriteLine(bool value);  
            ...
            }
  
        Because only methods, constructors, and indexed properties can have parameters, 
        only those members can be overloaded.

        Overloading is one of the most important techniques for improving usability, productivity, and readability of reusable libraries.
        Overloading on the number of parameters makes it possible to provide simpler versions of constructors and methods. 
        Overloading on the parameter type makes it possible to use the same member name for members performing identical operations on a selected set of different types.
        
            ✓ DO try to use descriptive parameter names to indicate the default used by shorter overloads.
