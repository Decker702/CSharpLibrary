                Create a list of value types. (int, string, bool, float, double, decimal)
                Create two examples for each type. One is a declaration only.
                The other is a declaration with initializer.
                Print a view of the values in the console.

            SILVER CHALLENGE:
                Use those types to concatenate a string.Any string will do.


           GOLD CHALLENGE:
              Declare the year you were born as a string.
                Convert that variable from a string to an integer and print it with a message in the
                  console.
                For instance, "I was born in 1976." */
